                The lesson learned from this story is: steady effort and determination are more valuable and
                more important than natural talent alone. The hareâ€™s mistake was underestimating his opponent and
                overestimating his own ability. The tortoise was patient and resilient, which ultimately led him
                to victory. The story serves as a reminder that success comes not just from speed but from persistence
                and dedication.
